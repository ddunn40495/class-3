# Start Postgres

1. Instantiate a new DB directory (if needed)
1. Connect to Postgres through CLI

There are a few ways to connect to Postgres - it depends, mostly, on how you installed it/your system version/configuration.

## Instantiate a new DB directory

If using the OSX app that https://www.postgresql.org/ provides, you can tell it where to store its data:

```sql
initdb -D ~/Desktop/postgres_db/ - create the directory
postgres -D ~/Desktop/postgres_db/ - start postgres, using that directory
```

If you used homebrew to install, use

```
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres/
```

## Connect to PostGres through CLI

If using the OSX app that https://www.postgresql.org/ provides, you can list sub dbs from the terminal:

```sql
psql -l -- list all subdatabses, if you found one that you want to use run the following:

psql db_name -- start psql app, using the sub database db_name

-- if you need to create a db to use
createdb intro_to_sql
psql intro_to_sql
```


Once inside the `psql` app, you can list the sub databases like this:

```sql
\l
```

- if that doesn't work, try adding a symbolic link, in terminal:

```bash
ln -s /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/psql /usr/local/bin/psql
```

- To stop/start the db click the buttons on upper right of the app
